# Gaming Computer Assembly Courses

--- 
The project involves a site for enrolling clients in courses on assembling gaming PCs.

The layout of the site was made in the Figma editor.

In total, the site has 6 blocks:
  + Information
  + Accessories
  + Registration for the course
  + Contacts
  + Authorization/registration
  + Basket

Initially, the client gets to the home page of the site, where, for ease of use,
chooses for himself how best to move between blocks - a consequence of the swipe down
or by choosing on the header of the site.

    Home page + header
The screenshot below shows the start page to which the user
hit when the site loads.

The main functionality of this page is site navigation and content.
general information on the topic. An active "Order Now" button redirects the user
to the block of information about the course. The slider at the bottom contains general information about the pros of having a powerful computer.
User authorization is performed after pressing the button with the "user" icon.
The cart button, when clicked, will show the contents of the cart.

    At this stage, you can identify the main functionality of the site.
The user enters the "components" section, where he selects the desired ones and adds them to the basket.
It is possible to enroll in a course on a separate block of the site (at the same time, the cost of the course when registering for it
automatically added to the total cost of the basket).
